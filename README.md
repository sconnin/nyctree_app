# nyctree_app
This is a web application that can be used to track the overall health status of tree species in NYC boroughs. The data are drawn from NYC Open Data using Socrata API. The app currently deploys on a Heroku server and is in draft form.

Example questions that this app can address:

* What proportion of tree (by species) are in good, fair, or poor health?
* Does the presence/activity of neighborhood tree stewards have an impact tree health? 

Intended updates:

* redesign and reskin the application with Bootstrap to be more attractive and UI friendly
